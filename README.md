# 1Photon_Analysis

## Introduction ##

This code is mainly a wrapper for several other amazing project and streamlines it's usage to generate a coherent data output. If you want to learn more about the underlying packages you can read about the [Motion Correction](https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-33-2-156), [CNMFE](https://elifesciences.org/articles/28728) and the [Sheintuch](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(17)31430-4.pdf) and [Ahanou](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aap8586) cross-day registration. You can also check out the code, [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18401-efficient-subpixel-image-registration-by-cross-correlation), [here](https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E), [here](https://github.com/zivlab/CellReg) and [here](https://github.com/bahanonu/ciatah).

For a complete, mantained implementation of many Miniscope Analysis tools I highly recommend the package of Biafra Ahanonu [CIAtah](https://github.com/bahanonu/ciatah). It comes with a wide range of GUIs that help with navigation for inexperienced users. This code repository serves as a minimal implementation of the afromentioned repositories and can be a good tool for people that look to customize their own pipelines or are looking for a code that is streamlined and works, well out of the box without much parameter tuning and has been tested on data from vHPC, PFC, AuC, NAc, BLA and CeA.

The code was used to process all miniscope data, published in [Courtin et al]().

## Installation ##

The easiest way to use this code is to clone the repository in Matlab. You can check out how to do it [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/retrieve-from-git-repository.html) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7A27uMduo0).
